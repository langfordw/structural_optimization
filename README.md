# Computational Structural Design and Optimization

For a computational structural design and optimization class, I developed a design and simulation tool for discretely assembled mechanisms.

My research in digital materials (in the Center for Bits and Atoms) looks to enable the "printing" complex systems in a single process. However, rather than achieving this through the use of additive-manufacturing, we're focusing on discrete assembly of individual building blocks.

One such application of this discrete assembly method is in the construction of mechanical mechanisms: with just four part-types (rigid, 1 degree-of-freedom, 2 degree-of-freedom, and vacant) a large diversity of mechansims can be assembled.

Designing and simulating these kinds of assemblies with conventional solidmodeling tools can be tedious and innacurate (given the large deformations). For this project, I aimed to create a tool which puts design and simulation in very close proximity to enable fast iteration and exploration of the discrete assembly design space.
